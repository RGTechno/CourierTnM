# Frontend Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the project's frontend on your local machine and get it up and running. Please follow the instructions carefully to ensure a smooth setup process.

## Steps
1. Run the command `npm install` in the terminal of the directory (frontend).
2. Change the `apiHost` in the [apiLoc.js](./src/apiLoc.js) to backend endpoint (`http://localhost:4545` for localhost, should be same as `proxy` in [package.json](./package.json)).

## Running the Frontend
> Run the command `npm start` in the terminal of the directory (frontend).

## Building the Frontend (for production)
> Run the command `npm run build` in the terminal of the directory (frontend).
